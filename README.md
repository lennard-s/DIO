# DIO Membership Tracker

## About

This project serves as our team's ISTE-500/501 Senior Dev project for the 2024-25 year. The goal of the project is to create a purpose-built, all-in-one membership tracker for the organizations associated with the RIT Diversity and Initiatives Office (DIO), including the Women in Computing organization (WiC) and the Computing Organization for Multicultural Students (COMS). Using a wide variety of libraries, frameworks, and platforms, we aim to create a membership tracker that promotes efficiency, ease of use, and expandability for its organizations.
